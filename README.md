## How to use it
Giving 2 directories DirDiff will recursively look for added and deleted files or folders.
At this step the content of the files is not compared. If you click "compare files" an checksum 
is calculated over all files (can be time-cosuming). After that also file differences are shown.
There are also regex filter to include or exclude specific files.

## Features
* Integrated Diff Gui (not ready!)

## TODO
* HexEditor-Widget to show binary files (from a external Project)
